<para>The toolbar family of classes allows an application to use toolbars in a variety of configurations and styles. </para>

    <detaileddescription>
<para>The toolbar is a popular user interface component and contains a set of bitmap buttons or toggles. A toolbar gives faster access to an application&apos;s facilities than menus, which have to be popped up and selected rather laboriously.</para>
<para>Instead of supplying one toolbar class with a number of different implementations depending on platform, wxWidgets separates out the classes. This is because there are a number of different toolbar styles that you may wish to use simultaneously, and also, future toolbar implementations will emerge which cannot all be shoe-horned into the one class.</para>
<para>For each platform, the symbol <ref refid="classwx_tool_bar" kindref="compound">wxToolBar</ref> is defined to be one of the specific toolbar classes.</para>
<para>The following is a summary of the toolbar classes and their differences:</para>
<para><itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>wxToolBarBase: This is a base class with pure virtual functions, and should not be used directly.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
A toolbar might appear as a single row of images under the menubar, or it might be in a separate frame layout in several rows and columns. The class handles the layout of the images, unless explicit positioning is requested.</para>
<para>A tool is a bitmap which can either be a button (there is no &apos;state&apos;, it just generates an event when clicked) or it can be a toggle. If a toggle, a second bitmap can be provided to depict the &apos;on&apos; state; if the second bitmap is omitted, either the inverse of the first bitmap will be used (for monochrome displays) or a thick border is drawn around the bitmap (for colour displays where inverting will not have the desired result).</para>
<para>The Windows-specific toolbar classes expect 16-colour bitmaps that are 16 pixels wide and 15 pixels high. If you want to use a different size, call <computeroutput>SetToolBitmapSize</computeroutput> as the demo shows, before adding tools to the button bar. Don&apos;t supply more than one bitmap for each tool, because the toolbar generates all three images (normal, depressed, and checked) from the single bitmap you give it.</para>
