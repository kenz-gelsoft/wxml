<para>IMPORTANT NOTE:</para>
<para>If you experience problems installing, please re-read these instructions and other related files (todo.txt, bugs.txt and osname.txt for your platform if it exists) carefully before mailing wx-users or the author. Preferably, try to fix the problem first and then send a patch to the author.</para>
<para>When sending bug reports tell us what version of wxWidgets you are using (including the beta) and what compiler on what system. One example: wxMotif 2.8.1, gcc 2.95.4, Redhat 6.1</para>

<sect2 id="plat_motif_install_1motif_simple">
<title>The simplest case</title>
<para>If you compile wxWidgets on Linux for the first time and don&apos;t like to read install instructions just do (in the base dir): <verbatim>&gt; ./configure --with-motif
&gt; make
&gt; su &lt;type root password&gt;
&gt; make install
&gt; ldconfig
&gt; exit
</verbatim> Afterwards you can continue with <verbatim>&gt; make
&gt; su &lt;type root password&gt;
&gt; make install
&gt; ldconfig
&gt; exit
</verbatim> If you want to remove wxWidgets on Unix you can do this: <verbatim>&gt; su &lt;type root password&gt;
&gt; make uninstall
&gt; ldconfig
&gt; exit
</verbatim> </para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="plat_motif_install_1motif_expert">
<title>The expert case</title>
<para>If you want to do some more serious cross-platform programming with wxWidgets, such as for GTK and Motif, you can now build two complete libraries and use them concurrently. For this end, you have to create a directory for each build of wxWidgets - you may also want to create different versions of wxWidgets and test them concurrently. Most typically, this would be a version configured with <ndash/>enable-debug and one without.</para>
<para>For building three versions (one GTK, one Motif and a debug version of the GTK source) you&apos;d do this: <verbatim>mkdir buildmotif
cd buildmotif
../configure --with-motif
make
cd ..

mkdir buildgtk
cd buildgtk
../configure --with-gtk
make
cd ..

mkdir buildgtkd
cd buildgtkd
../configure --with-gtk --enable-debug
make
cd ..
</verbatim> Note that since wxWidgets-2.6.0 you can install all those libraries concurrently, you just need to pass the appropriate flags when using them.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="plat_motif_install_1motif_error_simple">
<title>The simplest errors</title>
<para>You get errors during compilation: The reason is that you probably have a broken compiler. GCC 2.8 and earlier versions and egcs are likely to cause problems due to incomplete support for C++ and optimisation bugs. Best to use GCC 2.95 or later.</para>
<para>You get immediate segfault when starting any sample or application: This is either due to having compiled the library with different flags or options than your program - typically you might have the <computeroutput>__WXDEBUG__</computeroutput> option set for the library but not for your program - or due to using a compiler with optimisation bugs.</para>

<title>The simplest program</title>
<para>Now create your super-application myfoo.app and compile anywhere with <verbatim>g++ myfoo.cpp `wx-config --libs --cxxflags` -o myfoo

If you still don&apos;t have any success, please send a bug report to one of our mailing lists (see my homepage) INCLUDING A DESCRIPTION OF YOUR SYSTEM AND YOUR PROBLEM, SUCH AS YOUR VERSION OF MOTIF, WXMOTIF, WHAT DISTRIBUTION YOU USE AND WHAT ERROR WAS REPORTED. I know this has no effect, but I tried...</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="plat_motif_install_1motif_libs_gui">
<title>GUI libraries</title>
<para>wxWidgets/Motif requires the Motif library to be installed on your system. As an alternative, you may also use the free library &quot;lesstif&quot; which implements most of the Motif API without the licence restrictions of Motif.</para>
<para>You can get the newest version of the Lesstif from the lesstif homepage at:</para>

</sect2>
<sect2 id="plat_motif_install_1motif_libs_misc">
<title>Additional libraries</title>
<para>wxWidgets/Motif requires a thread library and X libraries known to work with threads. This is the case on all commercial Unix-Variants and all Linux-Versions that are based on glibc 2 except RedHat 5.0 which is broken in many aspects. As of writing this, virtually all Linux distributions have correct glibc 2 support.</para>
<para>You can disable thread support by running <verbatim>./configure --disable-threads
make
su &lt;type root password&gt;
make install
ldconfig
exit
</verbatim> </para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="plat_motif_install_1motif_cygwin">
<title>Building wxMotif on Cygwin</title>
<para>The normal build instructions should work fine on Cygwin. The one difference with Cygwin is that when using the &quot;--enable-shared&quot; configure option (which is the default) the API is exported explicitly using __declspec(dllexport) rather than all global symbols being available.</para>
<para>This shouldn&apos;t make a difference using the library and should be a little more efficient. However if an export attribute has been missed somewhere you will see linking errors. If this happens then you can work around the problem by setting LDFLAGS=-Wl,<ndash/>export-all-symbols. Please also let us know about it on the wx-dev mailing list.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="plat_motif_install_1motif_config">
<title>Create your configuration</title>
<para>Usage: <verbatim>./configure [options]
</verbatim> If you want to use system&apos;s C and C++ compiler, set environment variables CXX and CC as <verbatim>% setenv CC cc
% setenv CXX CC
% ./configure options
</verbatim> to see all the options please use: <verbatim>./configure --help
</verbatim> The basic philosophy is that if you want to use different configurations, like a debug and a release version, or use the same source tree on different systems, you have only to change the environment variable OSTYPE. (Sadly this variable is not set by default on some systems in some shells - on SGI&apos;s for example). So you will have to set it there. This variable HAS to be set before starting configure, so that it knows which system it tries to configure for.</para>
<para>Configure will complain if the system variable OSTYPE has not been defined. And Make in some circumstances as well...</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="plat_motif_install_1motif_options">
<title>General options</title>
<para>Given below are the commands to change the default behaviour, i.e. if it says &quot;--disable-threads&quot; it means that threads are enabled by default.</para>
<para>Many of the configure options have been thoroughly tested in wxWidgets snapshot 6, but not yet all (ODBC not).</para>
<para>You have to add <ndash/>with-motif on platforms, where Motif is not the default (on Linux, configure will default to GTK). <verbatim>--with-motif             Use either Motif or Lesstif
                         Configure will look for both.
</verbatim> The following options handle the kind of library you want to build. <verbatim>--disable-threads       Compile without thread support. Threads
                        support is also required for the
                        socket code to work.

--disable-shared        Do not create shared libraries.

--enable-monolithic     Build wxWidgets as single library instead
                        of as several smaller libraries (which is
                        the default since wxWidgets 2.5.0).

--disable-optimise      Do not optimise the code. Can
                        sometimes be useful for debugging
                        and is required on some architectures
                        such as Sun with gcc 2.8.X which
                        would otherwise produce segvs.

--enable-profile        Add profiling info to the object
            files. Currently broken, I think.

--enable-no_rtti        Enable compilation without creation of
                        C++ RTTI information in object files.
            This will speed-up compilation and reduce
            binary size.

--enable-no_exceptions  Enable compilation without creation of
                        C++ exception information in object files.
            This will speed-up compilation and reduce
            binary size. Also fewer crashes during the
            actual compilation...

--enable-permissive     Enable compilation without checking for strict
                        ANSI conformance.  Useful to prevent the build
                        dying with errors as soon as you compile with
                        Solaris&apos; ANSI-defying headers.

--enable-mem_tracing    Add built-in memory tracing.

--enable-dmalloc        Use the dmalloc memory debugger.
                        Read more at www.letters.com/dmalloc/

--enable-debug      Equivalent to --enable-debug_info plus
            --enable-debug-flag.

--enable-debug_info Add debug info to object files and
                        executables for use with debuggers
            such as gdb (or its many frontends).

--enable-debug_flag Define __DEBUG__ and __WXDEBUG__ when
                        compiling. This enable wxWidgets&apos; very
            useful internal debugging tricks (such
            as automatically reporting illegal calls)
            to work. Note that program and library
            must be compiled with the same debug
            options.

<title>Feature Options</title>
<para>Many of the configure options have been thoroughly tested in wxWidgets snapshot 6, but not yet all (ODBC not).</para>
<para>When producing an executable that is linked statically with wxGTK you&apos;ll be surprised at its immense size. This can sometimes be drastically reduced by removing features from wxWidgets that are not used in your program. The most relevant such features are <verbatim>--without-libpng    Disables PNG image format code.

--without-libjpeg   Disables JPEG image format code.

--without-libtiff       Disables TIFF image format code.

--without-expat         Disable XML classes based on Expat parser.

--disable-threads       Disables threads. Will also
                        disable sockets.

--disable-sockets       Disables sockets.

--disable-dnd           Disables Drag&apos;n&apos;Drop.

--disable-clipboard     Disables Clipboard.

--disable-streams       Disables the wxStream classes.

--disable-file          Disables the wxFile class.

--disable-textfile      Disables the wxTextFile class.

--disable-intl          Disables the internationalisation.

--disable-validators    Disables validators.

--disable-accel         Disables accel.
</verbatim> Apart from disabling certain features you can very often &quot;strip&quot; the program of its debugging information resulting in a significant reduction in size.</para>

<para>Now the makefiles are created (by configure) and you can compile the library by typing: <verbatim>make
</verbatim> make yourself some coffee, as it will take some time. On an old Pentium 200 around 40 minutes. During compilation, you may get a few warning messages depending in your compiler.</para>
<para>If you want to be more selective, you can change into a specific directory and type &quot;make&quot; there.</para>
<para>Then you may install the library and its header files under /usr/local/include/wx and /usr/local/lib respectively. You have to log in as root (i.e. run &quot;su&quot; and enter the root password) and type <verbatim>    make install
</verbatim> You can remove any traces of wxWidgets by typing <verbatim>    make uninstall
</verbatim> If you want to save disk space by removing unnecessary object-files: <verbatim> make clean
